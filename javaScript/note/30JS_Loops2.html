<!--
The While Loop:

Syntax:
while (condition) {
  code block to be executed
}

example:
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}

==> If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, 
the loop will never end. This will crash your browser.


The Do/While Loop:
==> The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. 
This loop will execute the code block once, 
before checking if the condition is true, 
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
do {
  code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
