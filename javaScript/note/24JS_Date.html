Dates:
JavaScript Date Object lets us work with dates:
Mon Dec 10 2018 16:34:45 GMT+0545 (Nepal Time)

By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display 
a date as a full text string:

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript new Date()</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var d = new Date();
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = d;
</script>

</body>
</html>

new Date()
new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds)
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(date string)


new Date():
==> new Date() creates a new date object with the current date and time:
var d = new Date();
Date objects are static. The computer time is ticking, but date objects are not.

new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds):
==> 7 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and millisecond (in that order):
var d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30, 0);
==> JavaScript counts months from 0 to 11.
January is 0. December is 11.

==> 6 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, minute, second:
var d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33, 30);

==> 5 numbers specify year, month, day, hour, and minute:
var d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10, 33);

==> 4 numbers specify year, month, day, and hour:
var d = new Date(2018, 11, 24, 10);

==> 3 numbers specify year, month, and day:
var d = new Date(2018, 11, 24);

==> 2 numbers specify year and month:
var d = new Date(2018, 11);

==> You cannot omit month. If you supply only one parameter 
it will be treated as milliseconds.
var d = new Date(2018);

new Date(milliseconds):
==> new Date(milliseconds) creates a new date object as zero time plus milliseconds:
var d = new Date(0);

==> 01 January 1970 plus 100 000 000 000 milliseconds is approximately 03 March 1973:
var d = new Date(100000000000);

==> January 01 1970 minus 100 000 000 000 milliseconds is approximately October 31 1966:
var d = new Date(-100000000000);

==> One day (24 hours) is 86 400 000 milliseconds.
var d = new Date(86400000);

new Date(dateString):
==> new Date(dateString) creates a new date object from a date string:
var d = new Date("October 13, 2014 11:13:00");
