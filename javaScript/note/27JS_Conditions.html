Conditional Statements:
==>if
==>if else
==>if... else if... else
==>switch

The if Statement:
==> Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be 
executed if a condition is true.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

==> Note: if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) 
will generate a JavaScript error.

example:
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";  
}


The else Statement:
==> Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be 
executed if the condition is false.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else { 
  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}

example:
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}


The else if Statement:
==> Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the 
first condition is false.

Syntax:
if (condition1) {
  block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

example:
if (time < 10) {
  greeting = "Good morning";
} else if (time < 20) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}

The Switch Statement:
==> Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax:
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    code block
    break;
  case y:
    code block
    break;
  default:
    code block
}

==> The switch expression is evaluated once.
==> The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
==> If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

example:
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
  case 0:
    day = "Sunday";
    break;
  case 1:
    day = "Monday";
    break;
  case 2:
     day = "Tuesday";
    break;
  case 3:
    day = "Wednesday";
    break;
  case 4:
    day = "Thursday";
    break;
  case 5:
    day = "Friday";
    break;
  case 6:
    day = "Saturday";
}

==>The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

==> break Keyword : When JavaScript reaches a break keyword, it breaks out 
of the switch block.

==> default Keyword: The default keyword specifies the code to run if there 
is no case match:
==> The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:
==> If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the default case with a break.
