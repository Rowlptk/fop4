<!--
Loops:
==>for - loops through a block of code a number of times
==>for/in - loops through the properties of an object
==>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
==>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

The For Loop:
Syntax:
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  code block to be executed
}
==> Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
==> Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
==> Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

==> You can initiate many values in statement 1 (separated by comma):
var cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Saab", "Ford"];
var i, len, text;
for (i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;

==> Statement 1 can be omitted:
var i = 2;
var len = cars.length;
var text = "";
for (; i < len; i++) { 
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}

==> Statement 3 can also be omitted:
var i = 0;
var len = cars.length;
for (; i < len; ) { 
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
  i++;
}


a = 10;
for(;;)
{
	if(a<=1)
	{
	break;
	}
	a--;
}
==> If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. 
Otherwise the loop will never end.
